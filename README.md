# JPB - Portfolio (2019)

This personal portfolio website was one of my first major projects, built with Laravel 7 back in 2019.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is no longer maintained and serves as an archive of my early work.

## üîß Built With

- **Laravel 7**
- **HTML**, **CSS (SASS)**, **JavaScript**
- **Blade templating**

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yjaphzs/jpb-portfolio.git

2. Set up a virtual host (e.g., in Apache, Laragon, or Valet) pointing to the project's /public folder. Make sure you're using PHP 7.4 for the server.
Example for Apache (add to httpd-vhosts.conf):
    ```bash
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot "C:/path/to/portfolio2019"
        ServerName portfolio.local
        <Directory "C:/path/to/portfolio2019">
            AllowOverride All
            Require all granted
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

  > Ensure PHP 7.4 is set in your Apache configuration:

3. Access the site in your browser using the configured local domain:
